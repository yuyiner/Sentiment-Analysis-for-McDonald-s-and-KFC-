# Sentiment Analysis for McDonalds and KFC

When it comes to fast food, the top two options that jump into peopleʼs mind are McDonalds and KFC. McDonalds and KFC have become famous fast-food brands worldwide for many decades. They are the main competitors for each other. Each year, both will create different marketing campaigns to increase awareness of the brand and attract customers' attention.

For example, McDonalds is holding its “Coast to Coast Monopoly” game recently, and KFC is providing “free meals” to the flood victims in Pakistan. Such marketing campaigns will take a lot of effort and it is very important for the companies to understand customersʼ feelings about their brand and how well their marketing strategies perform.

In todayʼs world, with the advance of the internet, people have many places to express their feelings and opinions. Twitter is one of the most popular social media platforms that allow people to share information and opinions effectively. In this project, we will collect tweets data using Twitter API for McDonalds and KFC, then use text analysis techniques and create word clouds to discover the trending topics between the companies. Further, we will also do a sentiment analysis to find out how people feel about them.

Project in collaboration with Christopher Lin and Sonal Bimbra.
